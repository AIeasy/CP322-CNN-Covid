# CP322-CNN-Covid: COVID-19 Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project aims to develop a classifier capable of determining whether a patient has COVID-19 based on their lung X-ray images.

## Setup

To set up the environment for this project, please download Anaconda from the following link: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

## Results

![Loss graph](https://github.com/AIeasy/CP322-CNN-Covid/blob/main/img/loss.png?raw=true)

As illustrated in the graph above, the model converges to a 0.2 loss with an accuracy of approximately 82%. This indicates a satisfactory performance.

![Prediction results](https://github.com/AIeasy/CP322-CNN-Covid/blob/main/img/predict.png?raw=true)

By generating predictions using the `predict_generator` function on the test data, it becomes evident that the model is performing remarkably well.
